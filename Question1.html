    <h1>The Feature of HTML 5 are as follows </h1>
    <ol>1. Semantic Elements</ol>

<ol>4. Geolocation API</ol>
<p>The Geolocation API is an HTML feature that is used to access the geographical position of a user, however, it is not accessed unless the user approves of it.

<h3>Question 3. Define accessibility in the context of web development?</h3>
<p>Accessibility in Web Development: Accessibility in web development refers to designing and coding websites
    in a way that ensures people with disabilities can perceive, understand, navigate, and interact with digital
    content effectively. It involves making web content inclusive and usable for everyone, regardless of their
    abilities.</p>
    <p>Importance of Accessible Websites:</p>
    <ol><li>
        Reading captions for a video when in noisy or quiet environments</li>
<li>Adjusting screen brightness in a dark or bright room</li>
<li>Reading a transcript of a presentation to reinforce the information learned Reading a transcript of a presentation to reinforce the information learned</li>
<li>Using the keyboard to navigate a website when the mouse is not working</li>
    </ol>
    <h4>Three ways in which accessibility in html helps us </h4>
    <ol><li><p><b>Alternative Text :</b>
        The alt attribute provides an alternate text for an image, if the user for some reason cannot view it (because of slow connection, an error in the src attribute, or if the user uses a screen reader).</p></li>
    <li><p><b>Declare the Language : </b>You should always include the lang attribute inside the <html> tag, to declare the language of the Web page. This is meant to assist search engines and browsers.</p></li>
    
<li><p><b>Good for SEO : </b>search engines give more importance to keywords inside headings, links, etc. than keywords included in non-semantic <div>s, etc., so your documents will be more findable by customers.</p></li>
</ol>
